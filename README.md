# Smart Plasma & Platelet Donation Management System

## Overview
This project is an automated phone-based platform that connects blood banks with willing donors in real-time. It uses **Twilio's voice call and SMS capabilities** to manage donor queues, notify donors, and streamline the donation process.

## Features
- **Automated Queue Management**: Maintains a list of willing donors for plasma and platelets.
- **Urgency Mode**: Allows blood banks to contact donors immediately during emergencies.
- **SMS Notifications**: Sends reminders and updates to donors.
- **Scalable**: Can handle multiple donors and blood banks.

## How It Works
1. **Donor Registration**:
   - Donors call the system and select their donation preference (Plasma or Platelets).
   - If the blood bankâ€™s inventory is full, donors are added to a **waiting queue**.
2. **Real-Time Notifications**:
   - When the blood bank needs plasma or platelets urgently, they can **instantly contact donors** from the queue.
3. **Automated Communication**:
   - The system uses **voice calls and SMS** to inform donors about available slots, notify them during emergencies, and provide updates.

## Benefits
- **For Blood Banks**: Efficient donor management, improved inventory control, and life-saving capabilities.
- **For Donors**: Convenience, flexibility, and the ability to make a meaningful impact.
- **For Patients**: Faster access to plasma and platelets during emergencies.
